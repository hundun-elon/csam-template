\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Introduction}
% introduction paragraph.
  In education technology, auto grading of free text has long been a sought-for solution,
  particulary in large-scale assessments and technical subjects like Computer Science , where
  assessments cannot be easily reduced to multiple choice questions. As the number of students enrolled in 
  a course increases per instructor and the curriculum becomes more demanding, educators face a mounting pressure
  to provide fair, consistant and fast feedback.\\

  This posses a need to try to automate the process of marking and giving feedback. In the
  state of art of education right now, your instructor grades your assessments and 4 years later 
  provides you with a feedback, as we can argue without proof that early feedback helps students 
  perform better in their studies. \\

At the same time, Large Language Models(LLMs) like GPT-4, Claude, and open-source alternative
such as LLaMA and DeepSeek are proving to be not just the conversational tools but
they are capable evaluators, summarizers, and even tutors. Their impressive capacity
for natural Language understanding and generation raises an exciting possibility:

Can these models be harnessed to grade student responses automatically and meaningfully?
--and perhaps even provide personalized feedback that guides learning?


\section{Purpose of this review}
% \subsection{This is a Subsection}
% \subsubsection{This is a subsubsection}
The aim of this review is to syntesize and critically examine recent research
on the use of LLMs for autograding and feedback generation in educational contexts.
We shall look at how these models have been applied to assess student submissions,
what techniques have been used to improve reliability and fairness, and how feedback
mechanisms are integrated to support and elevate student learning.\\
By comparing methodologies, models and findings we aim to infer what is 
working, what remains challenging, and where there's space for improvement.
This should ultimately inform how we design our own LLM-based grading system 
for technical subjects, one that minimizes educators workload while enhancing the feedback experienca 



\section{Brief overview of the key themes}
Across the literature I have examimed, several key themes and technical strategies emerge.

\begin{table}[h!]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|p{5cm}|p{12cm}|}
  \hline
  \textbf{Theme} & \textbf{Approaches / Observations} \\
  \hline
  Grading Accuracy & LLMs like GPT-4 and fine-tuned BERT models show strong agreement with human graders. \\
  \hline
  Feedback Generation & Models like BeGrading and GPT-4 in science writing generate formative feedback students find useful. \\
  \hline
  Explainability & SHAP explanations and linguistic feature analysis offer insight into deep model decisions. \\
  \hline
  Data Efficiency & Active learning (uncertainty, topology, hybrid methods) helps reduce labeling needs. \\
  \hline
  Prompt Engineering & Careful prompt design significantly improves LLM grading consistency and relevance. \\
  \hline
  Peer/Human-in-the-loop & Hybrid systems using peer grading or instructor scaffolding improve fairness and training. \\
  \hline
  Open-Source Model Potential & LLaMA 2 and Falcon perform comparably to commercial models in bioinformatics grading tasks. \\
  \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Themes and Observations in AI-based Educational Assessment}
  \label{tab:grading_ai_themes}
  \end{table}
  

\subsection{A Subsection about Citation Style}
Citations are important. Citation style for Computer Science is:
\begin{itemize}
\item When used in the text, use the authors with the date in brackets:\\ \citet{klein17} say very important things.
\item When used as a reference after a face, put everything in brackets:\\ Import things are true \citep{klein17}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Compiling}
Remember to compile multiple times to resolve references. Usually:
\begin{verbatim}
pdflatex file.tex
bibtex file
pdflatex file.tex
pdflatex file.tex
\end{verbatim}


\chapter{Floats}
\LaTeX\ decides how to place images. It also does the referencing for you as seen in \Cref{fig:thing1}. If you have subimages, they should have their own captions and labels -- look into the subfig or subfigure packages.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.1\linewidth]{images/wits}
	\caption{This is an image}
	\label{fig:thing1}
\end{figure}

Figure captions are at the bottom. Table title are at the top of the table as seen in \Vref{tab:tab1}. There is a package called BookTabs which is \textit{way} better for tables and you should learn how to use that instead.

\begin{table}[p]
	\centering
	\caption{Table Name}
	\label{tab:tab1}
\begin{tabular}{cc}
	\hline
	Col1 & Col2\\
	\hline\hline 
	R0,C0 & R0,C1 \\ 
	R1,C0 & R1,C1 \\ 
	\hline
\end{tabular} 
\end{table}

Usually let \LaTeX\ handle the placement of floats unless you \textit{really} need to force it to do something else. The \texttt{float} package used above allows you to use \texttt{H} as the placement which means \textit{here and only here}. When using the float package, the placement options are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item h -- a gentle nudge to place it here if possible
\item t -- top of a page
\item b -- bottom of a page
\item H -- here and only here, do not move it at all
\item p -- on its own page
\end{enumerate}


\chapter{Some Referencing Tricks}
CleverRef and VarioRef are helpful:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Normal Ref: See Figure \ref{fig:thing1}
	\item CleverRef: See \Cref{fig:thing1} and \Cref{tab:tab1}
	\item CleverRef+VarioRef: See \Vref{fig:thing1} and \Vref{tab:tab1}
\end{itemize}

\chapter{IDE/Editors}
Overleaf has a great online editor for latex. Use it.

\chapter{Extra Stuff}\label{app:extra}
\section{What is an appendix?}\label{app:whatis}

An appendix is useful when there is information that you need to include, but breaks the flow of your document, e.g. a large number of figures/tables may need to be shown, but maybe only one needs to be in the text and the rest are just included for completeness.
